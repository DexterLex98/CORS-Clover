![CORS Clover](Assets/CORS-Clover.png)

## Description 
CORS-Clover uses python request for sending request to the website (endpoint), after the requests response is recieved by the script it parses the HTTP headers and shows you the important headers like
Allow-Control-Allow-Origin, Allow-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials. Which are required as necessary to understand the CORS vulnerabilty and further you can do your testing with the end point. Well CORS-Clover dumps the results in domain.json  

## Features
 
- Provide endpoints and automate the endpoint scan for CORS(Security Misconfiguration)
- Dumping the headers into a JSON file 
- Add multiple endpoint enumeration
